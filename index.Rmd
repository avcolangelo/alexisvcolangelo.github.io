## Welcome!

I'm currently a second-year MPH Epidemiology student with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). I created this website for the [Data Science I](https://p8105.com/) course. 

You can learn about me [here](about.html).

I often use [google](https://www.google.com) to do **data science**.
